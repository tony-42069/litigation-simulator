- [ ] Store analysis results in JudgeAnalytics and JudgePatterns tables
- [ ] Expose judge analytics via API endpoints
- [ ] Integrate with frontend for judge search and profile display

## 5. Case Outcome Prediction Engine
- [ ] Engineer features from case facts, judge data, jurisdiction, precedent, etc.
- [ ] Build and train ML models for case and motion outcome prediction
- [ ] Implement factor importance and "what-if" scenario analysis
- [ ] Store predictions and explanations in CasePredictions table
- [ ] Expose prediction endpoints in API
- [ ] Integrate with frontend for case prediction UI

## 6. Simulation Engine
- [ ] Implement simulation session management (start, save, load, summarize)
- [ ] Build question generation engine (templates, judge patterns, AI generation)
- [ ] Implement response evaluation and feedback system (metrics, strengths, improvements)
- [ ] Add opposing counsel argument generation
- [ ] Store simulation data (sessions, questions, responses, feedback) in DB
- [ ] Expose simulation endpoints in API
- [ ] Integrate with frontend for interactive simulation flows

## 7. Frontend (React)
- [ ] Build main layout: Header, Footer, Navigation
- [ ] Implement Dashboard with stats and recent simulations
- [ ] Judge Search and Profile pages (with analytics, charts)
- [ ] Case Prediction form and results visualization
- [ ] Simulation creation and session UI (Q&A, feedback, summary)
- [ ] Connect all forms and data flows to backend API
- [ ] Add authentication and user session management
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states

## 8. User Management & Authentication
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/JWT authentication in backend
- [ ] Create user registration, login, and profile endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based access control (admin, user)
- [ ] Integrate authentication in frontend

## 9. Admin & Training Tools
- [ ] Build endpoints/scripts for retraining judge and case models
- [ ] Add background tasks for data import and model training
- [ ] Create admin UI (optional) for monitoring and management

## 10. Deployment & DevOps
- [ ] Write and test deployment scripts for Docker Compose (dev/prod)
- [ ] Prepare Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment
- [ ] Set up AWS resources (ECR, ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, ALB) if using AWS
- [ ] Configure Nginx for HTTPS and reverse proxy
- [ ] Document deployment process and environment variables

## 11. Monitoring, Logging, and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up logging for backend, frontend, database, and Redis
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Add monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and alerting (optional)
- [ ] Write backup and restore scripts for PostgreSQL

## 12. Business & Marketing Readiness
- [ ] Prepare demo data and trial accounts
- [ ] Set up landing page and onboarding flow
- [ ] Draft initial marketing materials (case studies, guides)
- [ ] Plan outreach and customer acquisition steps

## 13. Documentation
- [x] Update and maintain technical documentation (README, API docs, architecture diagrams)
- [ ] Write user guides and onboarding docs
- [ ] Document all environment variables and configuration options
