---

**Ongoing:**
- [x] Track progress, update this TODO list as tasks are completed or requirements change
- [ ] Prioritize critical path items for 9-day launch
- [ ] Log blockers, bugs, and feature requests as issues in GitHub

## 14. CURRENT STATUS (As of April 19, 2025)

### Completed
- [x] Docker infrastructure setup with PostgreSQL and Redis containers running
- [x] Created comprehensive database schema
- [x] API endpoint definitions for all major features
- [x] Authentication system with JWT tokens
- [x] Environment configuration
- [x] Database connectivity testing
- [x] Core simulation engine implementation with timeline generation, scenario analysis, and financial impact calculations
- [x] Judge analysis system with API endpoints

### Recent Updates
- [x] Refactored case prediction module to properly require scikit-learn and pandas
- [x] Refactored judge analysis module to properly require spaCy and scikit-learn
- [x] Added clear error handling for missing dependencies in API endpoints
- [x] Created setup scripts (bash and PowerShell) for easy environment setup
- [x] Updated requirements.txt with specific versions of all dependencies
- [x] Added comprehensive .env.example file 
- [x] Implemented proper error handling in test scripts

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Prepare data for training and testing the ML models
2. Complete the Simulation Engine's question generation component
3. Integrate the components with API endpoints
4. Begin frontend implementation to connect to backend services

### Known Issues
- Requires scikit-learn, pandas, spaCy, and en_core_web_sm to function properly
- Judge analysis now requires spaCy's en_core_web_sm model to be installed
- Docker setup needs to be updated to include ML dependencies
- Need to implement proper model persistence for ML models
